## Basic Use Cases
- Code Explanation and Documentation
  - An Amazon Q Developer can explain code snippets or entire projects in natural language, making it easier for less technical users to understand what the code does.
  - It can help generate project documentation, user guides, or README files automatically so users can maintain up-to-date resources without manual effort.
- Project Planning and Design
  - Users can use Q to prepare for meetings by generating lists of requirements or initial design ideas based on project goals, or by asking about AWS services relevant to their project.
  - It assists in breaking down high-level problems into smaller, manageable tasks, making incremental progress easier for users who may not know best practices off-hand.
- Chat-Based Support and Troubleshooting
  - Amazon Q Developer provides chat interfaces in IDEs and DevSpaces, enabling users to ask questions about code errors, AWS resources, or workflow issues using natural language, without manually searching documentation.
  - It can suggest solutions and guide users step-by-step through troubleshooting and fix recommendations.
- Automated Routine Tasks
  - Q can auto-generate code snippets, refactor existing code, and even run deployment scripts for simple DevOps tasks, allowing users to automate routine actions directly from their workspace.
  - It helps non-experts navigate testing concepts, generate unit tests, or validate basic software operations, reducing the learning curve for new users.
- Features Supporting Less Technical Users
  - Natural language interface: Users interact conversationally rather than needing coding knowledge.
  - Integration with IDEs and DevSpaces: Available in popular editors, making access straightforward for beginners and less technical roles.
  - Step-by-step guidance: Promotes learning by breaking down tasks and offering explainable outputs that users can understand and reuse.
